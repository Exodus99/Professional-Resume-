          <p>"The Radiology team at Cleveland Clinic raved about our proactive monitoring. They said they’ve been trying to get vendors to do this for years, and Eric delivered. Eric notified them about an issue they didn’t even know they had and resolved it. The client was so appreciative and impressed with how proactive and thorough he was. Huge thank you to Eric for setting such a high standard and representing Viz so well!" 🎉</p>
